# SmartCare AI Light – Dataset Collection

This repository contains a collection of **Roboflow datasets** for training AI models in the **SmartCare AI Light** project, developed during the **SPIED 2025 International Workshop in China**.  
The datasets focus on detecting **vulnerable pedestrians** such as wheelchair users, people with crutches, and white cane users.

### 2. Vulnerable Group – Three Classes (~11,000 images)
A large-scale dataset with three classes: **wheelchair**, **crutches/cane**, and **other vulnerable group**.  
Perfect for robust, multi-class detection training.

## 📌 Recommended Use
- **Multi-class training** → Use the **Vulnerable Group – Three Classes** dataset as the base.
- **Specialized fine-tuning** → Add crutches or wheelchair datasets to improve specific detection.
- **Edge cases** → Use DIS‑Blind‑Wheelchair and White Cane Models for variety.
