# 1'st Presentation Scripts 
## Slide 1 – Title

Hello, we are Team OneAsia.
Today we present SmartCare AI Light — an intelligent traffic light that helps people cross safely.

## Slide 2 – Team Intro

Our team has members from Korea, Japan, and China.
We aim to solve real problems with technology.

## Slide 3 – Background

The idea came from my own experience.
My friend with a broken leg couldn’t cross before the light turned red.
I thought — why not give more time to people who really need it?

## Slide 4 – Who & For What

Users: people with disabilities or limited mobility.
Purpose: safe crossing, less stress, and more respect in public.

## Slide 5 – When & Where

Use anytime, day or night.
Especially at hospitals, elderly homes, busy intersections, and school zones.

## Slide 6 – Why Needed

Problem: Current lights treat everyone the same, but some walk slower.
Cars wait, green time is wasted, traffic jams happen.
Existing systems only warn — ours takes action.

## Slide 7 – How It Works

Camera detects vulnerable pedestrians using AI.
Green light is extended until they cross.
Then cars get their full green time — safer and smoother traffic.

## Slide 8 – Two Methods

Method 1: YOLO — detect wheelchairs or canes directly.
Method 2: Pose — analyze body positions to detect walking difficulty.

## Slide 9 – Conclusion

SmartCare AI Light keeps pedestrians safe and traffic moving.
Thank you.
